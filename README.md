# unread-badge

This is a simple Thunderbird extension for displaying an unread mail message count
on the Windows taskbar.

Currently (up until at least Thunderbird 60.0, at ths time of this wring) the only
unread notification option is to put an icon into the notification area (or,
[as it is often called](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20030910-00/?p=42583),
the system tray). Windows 7 and later allow you to badge the application's icon itself
with an overlay. The Mozilla core [supports setting the overlay](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=515907),
but the [bug for actually making Thunderbird do so](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=494137)
has existed since 2009 and is as yet unresolved. (Please vote for it!)

So I cobbled this together.

This extension will add an overlay for the combined unread message count across all
mail accounts.

A configuration panel lets you choose between counting messages in all folders, or
to count the primary inbox only.
